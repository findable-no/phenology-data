Below is an instruction that describes a task, write a response that appropriately completes the request.

You are an expert at reading handwritten table entries.  I will give you a snippet of a table and you will
read the text in the snippet and return the text as a string.

The texts can consist of the following:
1) A number only, the number can have from 1 to 3 digits.
2) A number surrounded by ordinary parenthesis.
3) A number surrounded by sqaure brackets.
5) The letter 'e', 's' or 'k'
6) The percent sign '%'
7) No text at all (blank image).

Instructions:

**General Rules**:
    - Return the text as a string.
    - If the snippet contains no text, return: "unknown".
    - In order to separate the digit 1 from the digit 7, know that the digit 7 always will have a horizontal stroke appearing in the middle of the digit.
      If there is no such horizontal stroke, the digit is a 1 even if it might look like a 7.
    - Beware that the text will often be surrounded by a black border, do not confuse this with the text.  In particular
      it is easy to confuse the digit 1 with parts of the border. Borders should be ignored.
    - Ignore anything OUTSIDE the border.
    - Do not use any code formatting, backticks, or markdown in your response. Just output the raw text.
    - Respond **ONLY** with the string. Do not provide explanations or reasoning.
